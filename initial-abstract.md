###### **Green Grove - Gaming towards Sustainable Development**

##### **Need:**
|<p>- Humans can respond quickly to an immediate crisis; however, they are not adept at recognizing adversities that take a long time to develop (1). Managing a multitude of minor problems or tasks in our daily lives and leisure keeps people sufficiently busy impeding sustainable action. Although, scientific facts about climate change or the dangers of reckless consumption of resources are so compelling and, in some cases, known, and the consequences which arise in both cases are so dire, still humans are unable or unwilling to take individual action. (2). There is an immediate need to instill environmental awareness about climate change (SDG13) and responsible production and consumption (SDG12), both being key sustainable development goals of the United Nations for 2030.  
  
##### **Approach:**
</p><p>-  **Green Grove** is a game app designed for Android and iOS, centered around the theme of environment, and climate change integrated with fantasy elements to target the young adult population. The app provides a platform for the user to engage in multiple dimensions of sustainable awareness through an immersive and interactive experience. </p><p>The gameplay of Green Grove is 3 pronged- **Story**, **the Grove,** and **the Greenwood**, in which players can visit each other’s grove, adding a social aspect to the game. Green Grove aims to bring about sustainable practices into people’s everyday lives and increase awareness of the impact of their decisions on the environment. Every action by the user and its impact on the environment can be directly visualized in the grove.</p><p>The story of Green Grove centers around a person who visits a forest they used to play in as a child, years later, only to find that the forest is dying, and all the spirits of the forest have vanished. It is the player’s job to revive the forest. As players move through the game, they pick up information about Climate Change and other environmental problems and understand how everyone is currently contributing to those. The players must fill out a small survey after they download the game, determining their carbon footprint.</p><p>The forest shown after completing the quiz would be a representation of the player’s choices so players will be able to see the direct impact of their actions on the environment. **Actions such as changing from using plastic bags for grocery shopping and errands to a bag made of reusable, environmentally friendly material such as jute, cause changes in the state of the forest, which will come back to life in steps as sustainable practices that are suggested in the app are followed.** Players will do these tasks for points, which are redeemed weekly and used in a summoning feature.</p><p>The summoning feature works as follows:</p><p>- Weekly upkeep of the forest through real-life sustainable practices rewards the player with gems that they can use to summon cards needed to pass missions to proceed in the story.</p><p>- The cards will be of 4 categories- red, blue, green, and yellow- depicting the respective elements of the spirits.</p><p>- Points will be rewarded once the player sends a picture of the sustainable choice through an image recognition software inbuilt within the game.</p>

##### **Benefits:**
<p>- Green Grove, unlike most efforts to involve people to adopt sustainable practices, is interactive and immersive. Showing people, the impact that their actions have on the environment in real-time using a mathematical model and user data will allow players to have a constantly changing reflection of their individual influence on the environment. The reality is that climate change and reckless consumption are global and not local problems - problems encountered in one area are no longer limited to only that area - they affect everyone.</p><p>

  Green Grove, through gamifying sustainable development practices aims to increase awareness and bring about long-term change in people’s individual lifestyles. Through such gameplay, people will not only become aware of climate change, and their individual contribution to environmental problems but also become incentivized to adopt sustainable practices. Green Grove not only has a larger reach than most campaigns for sustainability due to its nature as an app but is also innovative, unlike traditional campaigns. It brings about both awareness and actualizes knowledge into action simultaneously. Green Grove is unique as it would be the only game that covers environmental issues in the genres of simulation, role-playing, and puzzles. With a compelling storyline, Green Grove would be a game that continues to catch the player’s attention, unlike others within the niche (e.g., Logicity game).</p><p>This kind of experience would be efficient at making the issues relevant to people because players tend to invest their hopes in a game character whose fate depends on them. Green Grove aims at making the player “experience” the consequences of their actions firsthand and see how dire the situation is, rather than being told about it, to stimulate a deeper and more personal reflection on the topics.</p><p>The game has the potential to be an eye-opener to people who have become accustomed to the ordinary means of communicating about SDGs and climate change. The final aim of Green Grove is to have everybody play the game, reflect, discuss, and act on it. The game is well suited to encourage discussions about climate change and reckless consumption thus also having application in classrooms.</p>
  
  ##### **Competition/alternatives:**
  
  <p>-  Games are some of the most downloaded apps, especially by those between the ages of 15 to 30. Users spend at least 10% of their time on apps on games and mobile games as of 2018, accounting for 33% of all installed apps. Green Grove falls into the categories of simulation, puzzle, and adventure. These elements are some of the most popular for game retention. As a mobile game, Green Grove has the maximum reach as mobile gaming has become the most popular platform and reaches a more diverse audience.</p><p>Unlike other games centered around sustainable development, Green Grove is an app, widely available to all who have a smartphone. This increase in accessibility would lead to more people becoming aware of environmental issues and adopting sustainable practices. Green Grove, being an app, would have a wide reach. With a target audience of those from mainly 15-30 years old, Green Grove would bring about a platform in which those who have the most ability to bring significant change would be amenable to adopting sustainable practices.</p>

  Due to the scope and longevity that Green Grove offers; it has the potential for gamifying environmental education. Introducing game design elements and experiences can support the learning process since by incorporating these game elements into education, players can be engaged in a productive learning experience and change their behaviors in a positive manner (3). Actualizing knowledge into change, especially by the youth of the world will result in more sustainability not only in the current generation but also in the coming ones.</p>|
